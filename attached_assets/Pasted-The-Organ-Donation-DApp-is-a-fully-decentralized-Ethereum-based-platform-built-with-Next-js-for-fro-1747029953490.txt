The Organ Donation DApp is a fully decentralized, Ethereum-based platform built with Next.js for frontend, Ganache for local blockchain simulation, and smart contracts written in Solidity that manage organ donations, matching, and transplants. Users can register via MetaMask and select their roles—Donor, Patient, or Admin—with role-specific dashboards and privileges. Donors can register organs (e.g., kidney, liver), which are minted as NFT-like tokens stored on-chain with metadata stored on IPFS, while patients can request organs and track match statuses. Admins have elevated access to verify users, trigger or approve organ matching, and mark donations as completed, all in real-time using event listeners. The DApp features a real-time stats dashboard with total donations, active users, and successful matches, updating dynamically via smart contract events. Organ matching can be enhanced through an off-chain AI-assisted Node.js or Python Flask service that recommends recipients based on blood type, distance, and viability, returning scores and addresses to the smart contract for match execution. A Demo Mode provides fake users and simulated flows for testing and hackathons, while the Admin Panel features analytics, verification tools, and even DAO-style governance voting for hospital coordination using Snapshot or simple smart contracts. Additional features include secure MetaMask wallet integration, role-based navigation, toast notifications, NFT-based donor badges with QR links, geolocation-aware matching via postal codes or oracles, encryption and decentralized storage for sensitive medical data, and support for zk-SNARK privacy proofs for advanced demos. Every component, from organ galleries to request pages, updates in real time by listening to blockchain events, ensuring the UI is always synced with on-chain state. Deployment uses Hardhat scripts connected to Ganache, allowing for local testing and rapid iteration with smart contract logs and event watchers to verify every transaction. The entire system is modular, secure, and scalable, creating a transparent and tamper-proof organ donation ecosystem that's privacy-preserving, auditable, and ready for public use or demo day flexing.
